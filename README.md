# RTT: An in-browser Real Time Strategy game

This repository contains a strategy game you can play in the browser. Inspired by RTS games such as Supreme Commander and Planetary Annihilation. Contributions welcome. You can play at [https://rtt.46b.it](https://rtt.46b.it/).

Spiritual successor to my past [RTS](https://github.com/46bit/rts) and [Tilewater](https://github.com/46bit/tilewater) projects.
